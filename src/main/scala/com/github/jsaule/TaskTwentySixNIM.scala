////TODO exercise
////Create class Nim (or NimGame or NimState) - if you can come up with a better name please do
////you could use case class if you want
////Objects created from this class will hold ALL information particular to a single game of NIM
////
////create two at least two methods
////TODO one will be removeMatches which will perform a move of units allowed by the rules of the game
//
////TODO 2nd method would be to print game status let's call this method showStatus - how many matches are in the pile, whose turn it is,
////
////TODO bonus: objects created from this class should also have a ArrayBuffer of moves
////so each time removeMatches is called this buffer is updated, thus we have an exact log of game moves
